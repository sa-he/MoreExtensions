# MoreExtensions

Sick of copy & pasting your favourit C# extension around your projects? 
Every time I write a new Extension method I'm sure, that someone else must already have written the exact same code.
So, let us join forces :)

This library is intended for:
- C# netstandard extensions
- No dependency to other nuget packages intended
- No overlapping with MoreLINQ (https://github.com/morelinq/MoreLINQ).

# Contribution
Please contribute your extensions that match the previously mentioned criterias via issue or pull request. 
- Make sure, that all public members are fully documented via XML comments.
- Provide a unit test.
