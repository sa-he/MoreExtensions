# MoreExtensions

Sick of copy & pasting your favorite C# extension around your projects? 
Every time I write a new Extension method I'm sure, that someone else must already have written the exact same code.
So, let us join forces :)

This library is intended for:
- C# netstandard extensions
- No dependency to other nuget packages intended
- No overlapping with MoreLINQ (https://github.com/morelinq/MoreLINQ). MoreLINQ tends to 'just' extend the default LINQ extension. This library is supposed to hold everything else.

http://www.codeplex.com/extensionoverflow seems to have been something like I'm intending MoreExtension to be(come). Therefore, I plan to include these extensions as appropriate.
